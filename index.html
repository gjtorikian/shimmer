let first_text = `I remember him (I have no right to utter this sacred verb, only
one man on earth had that right and he is dead) with a dark passion
flower in his hand, seeing it as no one has ever seen it, though
he might look at it from the twilight of dawn till that of evening, a
whole lifetime. I remember him, with his face taciturn and
Indian-like and singularly remote, behind the cigarette. I remember
(I think) his angular, leather-braiding hands. I remember near
those hands a mate gourd bearing the Uruguayan coat of arms; I
remember a yellow screen with a vague lake landscape m the
window of his house. I clearly remember his Voice: the slow,
resentful, nasal voice of the oldÂ· time dweller of the suburbs, without
the Italian sibilants we have today. I never saw him more than
three times; the last was in 1887 ... I find it very satisfactory
that all those who knew him should write about him; my testimony
will perhaps be the shortest and no doubt the poorest, but
not the most impartial in the volume you Will edit .. My deplorable
status as an Argentine will prevent me from indulgmg m a dithyramb,
an obligatory genre in Uruguay whenever the subject IS an
Uruguayan. Highbrow, city slicker, dude: Funes never spoke th,:se
injurious words, but I am sufficiently certain I rep:esented for him
those misfortunes. Pedro Leandro Ipuche has wntten that Funes
was a precursor of the supermen, "a vernacular and rustic Zarathustra'"
I shall not debate the point, but one should not forget
that he 'was also a kid from Fray Bentos, with certain incurable
limitations.`

let second_text = `My first memory of Funes is very perspicuous. I can see him on
an afternoon in March or February of the year 1884- My father,
that year, had taken me to spend the summer in Fray Bentos. I
was returning from the San Francisco ranch with my cousin
Bernardo Haedo. We were singing as we rode along and being on
horseback was not the only circumstance determining my happiness.
After a sultry day, an enormous slate-colored storm had
hidden the sky. It was urged On by a southern wind, the trees
were already going wild; I was afraid (I was hopeful) that the
elemental rain would take us by surprise in the open. We were
running a kind of race with the storm. We entered an aI1eyway
that sank down between two very high brick sidewalks. It had
suddenly got dark; I heard some rapid and almost secret footsteps
up above; I raised my eyes and saw a boy running along the narrow
and broken path as if it were a narrow and broken waI1. I
remember his baggy gaucho trousers, his rope-soled shoes, I remember
the cigarette in his hard face, against the now limitless
storm cloud. Bernardo cried to him unexpectedly: "What time is
it, Ireneo?" Without consulting the sky, without stopping, he replied:
"It's four minutes to eight, young Bernardo Juan Francisco."
His voice was shrm, mocking.`
